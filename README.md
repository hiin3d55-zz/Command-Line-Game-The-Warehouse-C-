Become the worker! Move the boxes and clean the warehouse!

I have developed this game for my C project. In this game, you become the warehouse worker and you need to move the boxes to the target.
It's like a puzzle! If you want to challenge yourself, play the game!

To play the game, download the files.
Then in command promt, type in: cl /W4 *.c 
This will compile the program.
Finally, run the game by typing in: project
